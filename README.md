# Neural Artistic Style Transfer using Tensorflow 
Neural Artistic style transfer is transferring of style from the style image to the content of the content image. It uses two images as its input i.e. Stylr Image and Content Image, with the help of Convolutional Neural Network we are able to extract the style of the style image and content of the content image and transfer the style into the content.

## [What is a Convolutional Neural Network or CNN?](https://medium.com/technologymadeeasy/the-best-explanation-of-convolutional-neural-networks-on-the-internet-fbb8b1ad5df8)
CNNs are like Neural Network made up of learnable weights and biases. It works on multi-channeled images. Convolution Layer is the main Building block of CNN and Each layer consists of a number of filters. It also consists of a pooling layer which reduces the spatial size of the representation i.e. computations. CNN helps in detecting objects in images.

## Setup
* pip install Tensorflow
* pip install Numpy
* pip install Scipy
